# Math_Gladiator
An app to help kids learn math

This was created for an educational game development class. The app was never published to the app store.
It was worked on by me and Bryce Patterson who also has this app in his own repository at
https://github.com/BrycePaterson/MathGame

Gameplay: Kids battle in the gladiator arena with math questions. As they progress the questions get harder.
